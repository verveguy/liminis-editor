/**
 * Render every ```c4 fence in docs/ to an SVG, and keep a <picture> beside the
 * fence pointing at it.
 *
 * This is the GitHub half of the single-source-of-truth idea. On the docs site a
 * remark plugin swaps the fence for a live island and strips the <img>; on
 * github.com there is no build step, so the committed SVG is what a reader sees.
 * Same file, two renderings, one source.
 *
 * The rendering is done by `@liminis/diagrams/server` — the package's own
 * published entry point. Two things follow from that which are worth having:
 * the docs build exercises `/server` on every commit, which nothing else in CI
 * does, and the images cannot drift from what the library actually produces,
 * because they are produced by it.
 *
 *     node scripts/render-diagrams.mjs           write SVGs and update <img> tags
 *     node scripts/render-diagrams.mjs --check   fail if anything is out of date
 *
 * `--check` is what CI runs: a committed SVG that no longer matches its fence is
 * a stale picture on GitHub, and stale documentation is worse than none.
